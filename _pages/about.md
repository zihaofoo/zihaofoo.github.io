I am a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering and Computational Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). My Ph.D. thesis surrounds the development of novel separation systems for critical material extraction from salt-lakes, and from spent battery and magnet leachates. At MIT, I develop first-principles computational models to understand ion transport phenomena across polyamide membranes in nanofiltration (NF) and polysulfonated ion exchange membranes in electrodialysis (ED).
